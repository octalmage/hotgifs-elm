# HotGifs Elm

This is an experiment to play with Elm, but also to see if I would want to replace Hot Gifs UI with Elm. Hot Gifs is currently using Riot.js, but the ecosystem just isn't where Elm's is. Also Elm is just cool.

You can test the new interface here: https://octalmage.github.io/hotgifs-elm/

Current UI: https://github.com/octalmage/hotgifs
